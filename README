This is the README file for BibRetrieve.

			     INSTALLATION
			     ************
				   
For a user-installation, it should be sufficient to:

1) Put the files "bibretrieve.el" and "bibretrieve-base.el" in some
   directory, for example in "~/.emacs.d/bibretrieve/".
   This can be done by hand or using the following commands.

   $ mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d
   $ cd ~/.emacs.d
   $ git clone git://github.com/pzorin/bibretrieve.git

2) Add an instruction to the file "~/.emacs" to load BibRetrieve;
   something like that does the trick:

   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/bibretrieve")
   ; Recompile if .el is newer than .elc
   (byte-recompile-directory "~/.emacs.d/bibretrieve" 0)
   (load "bibretrieve")

3) (optionally) do a minimal configuration (see CONFIGURATION below).

4) Enjoy BibRetrieve calling "M-x bibretrieve" or "C-u M-x
   bibretrieve" from Emacs.

			    CONFIGURATION
			    *************

BibRetrieve can be configured with customize.
Anyway, it could be easier to add some line to the file "~/.emacs".

To configure the backends used, set the variable "bibretrieve-backends".
This is an alist with the names of the backends as keys
and the timeouts as values. The default configuration is:

	 (setq bibretrieve-backends '(("msn" . 10) ("arxiv" . 5) ("citbase" . 5)))

Urls are get through mm-url. As default, this works through the
library url. If you want to use an external program, like wget or
curl, set the variable "mm-url-program" to the program and the variable
"mm-url-use-external" to t.


			       BACKENDS
			       ********

Supported backends (with keys for "bibretrieve-backends") are at the moment:

	  Backend      Key		URL

	  ArXiv	       "arxiv"		"http://adsabs.harvard.edu"
	  MathSciNet   "msn"		"http://www.ams.org/mathscinet"
	  MrLookup     "mrl"		"http://www.ams.org/mrlookup"
	  Citebase     "citebase"	"http://www.citebase.org"
	  Inspire      "inspire"	"http://inspirehep.net"
	  ZB MATH      "zbm"		"http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath"

If you want to add a backend, read the Commentary section in the
source file "bibretrieve.el".


			   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
			   ****************

This program has been inspired by bibsnarf
(http://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/tools/bibsnarf.el).
The functions that create the urls for most backends are taken from there.

This program uses the library mm-url.

This programs also uses lot of function of RefTeX. The selection
process is entirely based on reftex-sel. Many function have also been
adapted from there.
