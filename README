This is the README file for BibRetrieve.

			     INSTALLATION
			     ************
				   
For an user-installation, it should be sufficient to:

1) Put the files "bibretrieve.elc" and "bibretrieve-base.elc" in some
   folder, for example in "~/.emacs.d/bibretrieve/".

2) Add an instruction to the file "~/.emacs" to load BibRetrieve;
   something like that does the trick:

	(load "~/.emacs.d/bibretrieve/bibretrieve")

3) (If you want) do a minimal configuration (see CONFIGURATION below).

4) Enjoy BibRetrieve calling "M-x bibretrieve", or "C-u M-x
   bibretrieve" from Emacs.

Note: if the byte-compiled file do not work, you can try instead with
the source files ".el" at point 1).


			    CONFIGURATION
			    *************

BibRetrieve can be configured with customize.
Anyway, it could be easier to add some line to the file "~/.emacs".

To configure the backends used, set the variable
"bibretrieve-backends". This is an alist with askeys the names of the
backends and as values the timeouts. The default configuration is:

	 (setq bibretrieve-backends '(("msn" . 10) ("arxiv" . 5) ("citbase" . 5)))

Urls are get through mm-url. As default, this works through the
library url. If you want to use an external program, like wget or
curl, set the variable "mm-url-program" to the program and the variable
"mm-url-use-external" to t.


			       BACKENDS
			       ********

Supported backends are at the moment:

	  ArXiv:              "http://adsabs.harvard.edu"
	  MathSciNet (msn):   "http://www.ams.org/mathscinet"
	  MrLookup (mrl):     "http://www.ams.org/mrlookup"
	  Citebase:           "http://www.citebase.org"
	  Inspire:            "http://inspirehep.net"

The corresponding keys to use for the variable "bibretrieve-backends"
are arxiv, msn, mrl, citebase, inspire.

If you want to add a backend, read the Commentary section in the
source file "bibretrieve.el".


			   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
			   ****************

This program has been inspired by bibsnarf
(http://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/tools/bibsnarf.el).  The functions
that create the urls for most backends are taken from there.

This program uses the library mm-url.

This programs also uses lot of function of RefTeX. The selection
process is entirely based on reftex-sel. Many function have also been
adapted from there.
